Development of the minified version of the Maxwell CANSlator board. Based on bare-minimum functionality requirements. 

Developed using Visual Studio Code with platformio integration. 

Directly supports teensy3.6/Kenetis K66 micro with a MCP2515 SPI<->CAN interface, in addition to VP230 and TAJ1050 CAN transcievers.
